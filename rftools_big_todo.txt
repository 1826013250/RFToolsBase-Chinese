* Timer: annoying to change the time. It resets to 1 (maybe use 'Apply' button)?
* Gui HUD is not bright enough (for builder for example)
* Test env controller


* Security system in RFTools Base: move code from GenericRFToolsBlock to a capability perhaps?
* Check if all itemHandler/energyHandler is properly persisted
* Get rid of all hardcoded SHIFT_MESSAGE in tooltips
* Think about the new manual system
