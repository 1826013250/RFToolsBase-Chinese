* Timer: annoying to change the time. It resets to 1
* Top driver for spawner is missing
* Gui HUD is not bright enough (for builder for example)

* Security system in RFTools Base: move code from GenericRFToolsBlock to a capability perhaps?
* Check if all itemHandler/energyHandler is properly persisted
* Get rid of all hardcoded SHIFT_MESSAGE in tooltips
* Think about the new manual system
